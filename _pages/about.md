I'm Pingsheng Li, a PhD student in Computer Science at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/) and [Mila - Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute](https://mila.quebec/en). I'm currently supervised by [Prof. Blake Richards](https://mila.quebec/en/directory/blake-richards). I primarily focus on topics at the intersection of NeuroAI, including but not limited to Generalist Multimodal Representation Learning, Foundation Models for Neural Data, and Embodied AI. I'm also interested in neurotechnology that combines VR/AR, EEG, fNIRS, and related tools to generate better data for neuroscience.

Previously, I've also completed a MSc at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) (Neuro-X, supervised by [Prof. Alexander Mathis](https://mathislab.org/)) and a BSc at McGill (Neuroscience & Computer Science, supervised by Prof. Blake Richards and [Prof. Jonathan Cornford](https://eps.leeds.ac.uk/computing/staff/15737/dr-jonathan-cornford)).
